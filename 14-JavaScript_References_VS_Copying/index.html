        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // how do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const obj3 = { ...person };

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
